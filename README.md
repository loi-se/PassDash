PassDash is an offline windows desktop program to store all your passwords in a secure and simple way. PassDash offers a clear 
overview over all your password data through a clear dashboard screen.

All passwords are stored in an encrypted XML file on your own computer harddisk.
Every password file has it's own unique master password. It is important to pick a hard-to-guess and an 
easy to remember master password for your password file. There is no mechanism within PassDash to retrieve lost 
or forgotten master passwords. The user is responsible for storing his master password.
